# Amazon-Clone

Amazon clone create with React and Firebase

Created this React app by following CleverProgrammer. Shoutout to Quazi and Sonny for all they are doing to help educate people like me. You guys Rock!!

App uses React on the front end and firebase for the backend. Bootstrap and Flexbox is used for styling.

My amazon clone is awesome! Users can create an account. Sign In and Sign Out. Add products to their basket, as well as remove items from the basket.

I will add more later to include processing payments and final checkout.
